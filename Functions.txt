In this project, we used SourceTree (a Git GUI) as a convenient and efficient tool to manage collaboration between two team members working on the same codebase.
We structured our project by dividing it into multiple header files, to ensurethe code is clean, modular, and easy to read.
Each header file is designed to be as independent as possible, allowing for future modifications or extensions with minimal impact on other parts of the project.

Here is an overview of the key headers and their responsibilities:
•	Manager: Handles the main menu and overall project flow.
•	Player: Defines the Player struct.
•	PlayerManager: Manages player-related functionality, such as creating a new player, selecting a player, and updating player scores.
•	SaveLoadData: Handles saving and loading of game data to and from a save file.
•	Timer: Tracks time for scoring purposes.
•	Rounds: Manages the progression of rounds and transitions between them.
•	Q&A: Generates random questions based on configurable parameters, validates user answers, and provides feedback accordingly.
•	ScoreCalculator: Calculates the player's score based on the duration of each round.
•	Visuals: Contains most of the visual elements of the project, including animations and ASCII art.
•	Title: Prints the project title.

Within each header, we implemented functions for specific actions, such as AnswerChecker, GetReadyForNextRound, and FinalScore, to keep the code organized and maintainable.

For the visual elements, we created a custom function called printg, which animates text output to enhance the user experience. Additionally, we incorporated ASCII art to make the visuals more engaging.
