Everyone likes math right?... right? :)

This is a simple game where you have to answer math questions as fast as possible
Each game consists of 3 rounds with increasing difficulty
Each round has 5 questions
Wrong answers will add a penalty of 2 seconds to your time so be careful!
Good Luck !


When you run the project for the first time you will be asked to enter a player name,
after one game is played, your information of: name and score get saved in a file. 
afterwards each new player added will automatically be added to the leaderboards
so dont worry if you close the game, the score will be saved for your next playthrought
the all players save so you can go the the leaderboard and see who is the best!


We work on this project with version manager ( SourceTree ) and git for easy push and pull commit..
we used Headers to organize the all project:
headers we had:
 
Manager - managed the project order of operations
player - create a player for the project
PlayerManager - managed the all players function ( New Player , Choose a Player , Update Player Score etc )
SaveLoadData - saveing and loading the all players data in file 
Timer - trak the time
Rounds - in rounds header we run the acsoull game and count the round time
Q&A - genegert the questions and cheking the answer 
ScoreCalculator - calculator the score
Visuals - controll the all visuals of the project
Title - print the title 

inside the headers we use functions for each relevant action (like AnswerChecker, GetReadyForNextRound , FinalScore etc )

for the Visuals we used printg (are function the we carte to print text with animition) and text ascii art.
